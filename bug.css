The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.myClass div {
  color: red;
}

#myId div {
  color: green;
}

#myId .myClass div {
  color: purple;
}

```

The issue is that the order of the selectors matters when they have equal specificity.  In this example, the selector `#myId .myClass div` is considered less specific than `#myId div`. Therefore, if an element matches both selectors, the `color: green` from `#myId div` will override the `color: purple` from `#myId .myClass div`. This is because the browser processes the CSS rules from top to bottom, and the first matching rule wins if both have the same specificity.
