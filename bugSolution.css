To solve the issue, rearrange the CSS rules to ensure that the more specific selector (`#myId .myClass div`) is listed before the less specific selector (`#myId div`). Here's the corrected code:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

#myId div {
  color: green;
}

.myClass div {
  color: red;
}

#myId .myClass div {
  color: purple;
}

```

By placing `#myId .myClass div` before `#myId div`, we guarantee that `color: purple` will be applied when an element matches both selectors, since it will be evaluated first.
